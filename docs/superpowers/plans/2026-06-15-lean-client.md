# v0.5.0 — The lean Adaptive-Node client

Implements ADR 0006. Goal: the MCP surface is **3 meta-tools**; the agent discovers an instance's
tools on demand and always names the instance it acts on; Node carries no passthrough boilerplate and
no static command-list dependency.

**Decisions (settled):** no default/active instance — `instance` required everywhere, hard error on
missing/ambiguous, even with one editor. On-demand discovery via `list_unity_tools(instance)`
returning tool data (no advertisement / no `list_changed`). Delete the 76 passthrough handlers; keep
the 3 Node-logic tools (`execute_menu_item`, `create_script`, `analyze_screenshot`) but invoke them
through `call_unity_tool` (Node-side interception) so the advertised surface stays the 3 meta-tools.

## Stage 1 — Safety: mandatory instance, remove the default  *(highest value; standalone)*
- `call_unity_tool` + `list_unity_tools`: `instance` becomes **required**; missing/ambiguous →
  hard, clearly-worded error (never a silent default).
- Delete `set_active_unity_instance` (handler + catalog entry + tests). Remove the manager's
  active/default connection (`getActiveConnection`) and `server.js`'s ownership of one active
  `UnityConnection` — handlers resolve a connection from the manager by explicit instance only.
- `list_unity_instances` stays (how the agent learns identifiers).
- Verify: test:ci, drift (catalog now 3 meta-tools + editor commands), dogfood (call with explicit
  instance works; omitted instance errors clearly). Review the commit.

## Stage 2 — Delete the passthrough surface; uniform invocation
- Remove the 76 passthrough `*ToolHandler.js` files + their `index.js` entries.
- Keep the 3 Node-logic handlers; add a Node-side dispatch table in `call_unity_tool`: if `tool` is a
  Node-logic tool → invoke its handler with the resolved connection; else → generic editor passthrough.
- `list_unity_tools(instance)` returns the **union**: the editor manifest's commands + the 3
  Node-logic tool descriptors (so all are discoverable through one path).
- Remove the typed-advertisement machinery (`UNITY_MCP_TYPED_TOOLS`, the typed branch of
  `filterListedTools` — the list is now just the meta-tools).
- Verify: test:ci, dogfood (discover via list_unity_tools; call editor + a Node-logic tool via
  call_unity_tool). Review the commit.

## Stage 3 — Manifest enrichment (field advertisement)
- Editor advertises **result** field hints alongside `params` in its handshake manifest (the
  catalog→`CommandCatalog.g.cs` generator emits result schemas; `Handshake.Commands` carries them).
- `list_unity_tools` surfaces params **and** result-field hints, so the agent learns result shapes on
  demand and drives `fields` projection well. Editor-sourced — no Node→catalog dependency.
- Verify: dotnet (generator/manifest), drift, dogfood (list_unity_tools shows result hints). Review.

## Stage 4 — Re-point the drift gate
- The catalog↔JS-inputSchema check is moot (JS passthroughs gone). Re-point `check-drift.mjs` to
  catalog↔editor-manifest (the C# `CommandCatalog.g.cs` / advertised manifest), so the contract is
  still gated without depending on hand-written JS handlers. Decide the catalog's residual role
  (build-time authoring artifact checked against the C# side).
- Verify: drift passes on the new basis; document in protocol/README.

## Cross-cutting
- Breaking change → v0.5.0 (version bump + publish are the maintainer's release actions).
- Review **every** feature commit (the v0.4.0 lesson — not just fixes).
- Keep the floor green each stage (dotnet, clean 2020.3 compile where C# changes).

## Resume marker
- [x] **Stage 1 — safety** (commit 1bf6908): `instance` required on call_unity_tool + list_unity_tools (new `manager.requireConnection`, hard error on missing/unresolved); `set_active_unity_instance` deleted; META_TOOL_NAMES→3. Active-connection machinery KEPT (passthroughs still use it; removed in Stage 2). 2-agent review → 1 HIGH (requireConnection had no unit tests — added 4 to unityConnectionManager.test.js) + doc-staleness (set_active removed from README/mcp-server-README/setup-guide; counts + the call_unity_tool example fixed; bootstrap CATEGORY map). test:ci 214, drift 81/79/78. Node-side change → verified by unit tests (the live MCP bridge runs a fixed server, can't reload mid-session).
- [x] **Stage 2a — Node-logic routing** (commit ee231c3, additive): core/nodeLogicTools.js (NODE_LOGIC_TOOLS registry + isNodeLogicTool + mergeNodeLogicSurface); call_unity_tool dispatches the 3 to `new Handler(conn).execute()`; list_unity_tools merges the override. Tests: nodeLogicTools.test.js + MetaTools routing cases. test:ci 219, drift 81/79/78.
- [ ] **Stage 2b — the big deletion** (do with fresh budget): delete the 73 pure-passthrough handler files + their index.js wiring → HANDLER_CLASSES = the 3 meta-tools only; delete their test files (PingToolHandler, CreateGameObjectToolHandler, Tier1And2Tools, IntrospectionTools, RawPassthrough, SceneHandlersPayload) + remove from test:ci. server.js drops the active connection → createHandlers(manager); meta-tool ctors take just `manager`. Remove the active machinery from the manager (getActiveConnection/setActiveInstance/activeOverride/activeTarget/ACTIVE_KEY + the prune special-case + getConnectionForInstance's null-default) and ListUnityInstances' active-marking. Remove UNITY_MCP_TYPED_TOOLS (toolExposure typed branch). **Re-point the drift gate FIRST** (validate catalog↔editor-manifest, not catalog↔JS — deleting JS handlers otherwise breaks it; do it as its own step, verify green WITH handlers present, then delete).
- [ ] **Stage 3** — manifest enrichment (editor advertises result-field hints; list_unity_tools surfaces them).
- [ ] **Stage 4** — finalize the drift re-point + docs.
